# 1. If Z is norm (mean = 0, sd = 1)
# z = norm (mean = 0, sd = 1)
# P(Z > 2.64)
1 - pnorm(2.64, 0 ,1)
# P(|Z| > 1.39)
1 - pnorm(1.39, 0 ,1)

#2. Suppose p = the proportion of students who are admitted to the graduate school of the University of California at Berkeley, 
# and suppose that a public relation officer boasts that UCB has historically had a 40% acceptance rate for its graduate school.
# Consider the data stored in the table UCBAdmissions from 1973. 
# Assuming these observations constituted a simple random sample, are they consistent with the officer's claim,
# or do they provide evidence that the acceptance rate was significantly less than 40%? Use an Î± = 0.01 significance level.
# Answer:
#Our null hypothesis in this problem is H0 : p = 0.4 and the alternative hypothesis is
#H1 : p < 0.4. We reject the null hypothesis if p is too small, that is, if
#(p - 0.4)/sqrt(0.4(1 - 0.4)/n) < z
#where L = 0.01 and -z0.01 is
-qnorm(0.99)
# Now we find the value of the test statistic and see where it falls relative to the critical value.
# We can find the number of people admitted and not admitted to the UCB graduate school with the following.
A = as.data.frame(UCBAdmissions)
head(A)
xtabs(Freq ~ Admit, data = A)
#Now we calculate the value of the test statistic.
prob <- 1755/(1755 + 2771)
(prob - 0.4)/sqrt(0.4 * 0.6/(1755 + 2771))

#Our test statistic is not less than ???2.32, so it does not fall into the critical region.
#Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the true proportion of students admitted to graduate school
#is less than 40% and say that the observed data are consistent with the officer's claim at the ?? = 0.01 significance level.
